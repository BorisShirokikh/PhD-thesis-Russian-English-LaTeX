\underline{\textbf{Organization of the Dissertation.}}
The \underline{Introduction} substantiates the relevance of the work, formulates the research goals and problems, outlines the scientific novelty, and describes the methodology and practical significance of the results.
\underline{Chapter~\ref{chap:mri}} analyzes the internal sensitivity of convolutional neural networks to domain shifts in MRI segmentation. A gradient-based layer selection method (SpotTUnet) is proposed, allowing autonomous and interpretable fine-tuning under data-limited conditions.
\underline{Chapter~\ref{chap:ct}} addresses domain shifts arising from reconstruction kernel variability. Two novel approaches are developed: a theoretically grounded augmentation method (FBPAug) and an unsupervised adaptation framework (F-Consistency), both demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and practical applicability in clinical imaging.
\underline{Chapter~\ref{chap:da_bench}} introduces the large-scale M3DA benchmark for evaluating unsupervised domain adaptation in 3D medical image segmentation and presents the BGP dataset, offering a realistic “in-the-wild” validation scenario.
\underline{Chapter~\ref{chap:ood_bench}}  develops an evaluation framework for OOD detection in medical images and proposes a computationally efficient method, IHF, which achieves top-ranked results in international challenges.
The \underline{Conclusion} summarizes the main scientific results, their theoretical and practical significance, limitations, and outlines prospects for future research.

% Template and formatting:
% All Skoltech theses have an abstract
% One thesis had chapter summary at the end of each chapter. Looks like a good idea
% Introduction is apparently just a regular chapter
