\underline{\textbf{The relevance of the research area. The degree of its development.}}
The rapid advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have established a strong foundation for automating medical image segmentation tasks~\cite{lee2017deep}. Segmentation algorithms, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved near human-level performance across a variety of clinical applications, including brain tumor, lung cancer, organ-at-risk, and liver tumor segmentation. These algorithms continue to evolve, offering increasingly accurate results.

A major focus of our research was to evaluate and integrate DL methods into real-world clinical workflows. One of the earliest examples is the deployment of an automatic segmentation system for stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases at the Moscow Gamma-Knife Center~\cite{shirokikh2022systematic}. Radiosurgery demands submillimeter precision in target delineation, where even minor variability between specialists can affect the radiation dose distribution and, consequently, treatment outcomes. The developed CNN-based segmentation model significantly improved the clinical workflow by reducing inter-rater detection disagreements by 48\%, enhancing contouring consistency (surface Dice score increased from 0.845 to 0.871), and halving the delineation time. The model was validated through a prospective clinical study involving four experts and twenty patients, showing its potential as a reliable assistant in radiosurgical planning. This work demonstrated that DL-based tools can yield measurable improvements in diagnostic precision and efficiency, highlighting their immediate clinical applicability and setting a methodological precedent for future clinical evaluations of DL systems.

Another practically oriented line of research addressed the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the radiology departments of Moscow healthcare institutions faced extreme diagnostic loads. In collaboration with the Research and Practical Clinical Center for Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, we developed a DL-based triage system for chest CT scans~\cite{goncharov2021ct}. The proposed multitask CNN model jointly performed COVID-19 identification and severity quantification, effectively prioritizing patients for urgent care. Trained on approximately 1500 (mostly unannotated) CT studies and evaluated on an independent test set of 123 studies, the model achieved ROC AUC scores up to 0.97 for COVID-19 identification versus healthy controls and a 0.97 Spearman correlation for severity estimation. This system was successfully integrated into the Moscow healthcare workflow~\cite{covid-program}, accelerating patient sorting and resource allocation during the pandemic.% Beyond its immediate public health value, the project demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of DL systems in large-scale, heterogeneous medical environments.

These two implementations -- one in precision radiosurgery, the other in large-scale public healthcare -- demonstrate the high clinical relevance and transformative potential of DL methods in medical imaging.

Despite these successes, the widespread adoption of DL in medical imaging remains hindered by the significant drop in neural network performance when applied to data that differs from the training set. This challenge, known as \textbf{domain shift}, is particularly prevalent in medical imaging due to variations in scanner acquisition parameters, the introduction of new imaging modalities, and differences in patient populations. Even models that perform reliably in controlled or retrospective evaluations may degrade sharply once the imaging equipment or acquisition conditions change.

A practical instance of this problem was observed during the deployment of the Gamma-Knife segmentation system. In 2020, the MRI scanner at the clinic was replaced, resulting in visually distinct images with altered intensity distributions. The previously validated model, which had operated reliably for several years, began to produce a large number of false-positive contours, increasing the manual workload for radiologists instead of reducing it. Since the Gamma-Knife center treats approximately 400 patients per year and rare pathology cases were available only in the historical dataset (2005â€“2017), assembling a new annotated dataset of sufficient quality would require several years, which is impractical for clinical use. This situation motivated the study of \textit{supervised domain adaptation in the extreme low-data regime}, aimed at adapting a deployed model when only a limited number of annotated target scans are available.

This clinical demand shaped the subsequent research direction, which we follow in our works~\cite{shirokikh2020first,zakazov2021anatomy}. In this part of the study, we formalize the problem of supervised domain adaptation under conditions of severe annotation scarcity and analyze the internal sensitivity of CNNs to scanner-induced domain shifts. The analysis reveals that existing methods and architectures are not optimized for such low-data regimes and provide little understanding of which components of the model are most affected by distributional changes. Furthermore, the field lacks interpretable adaptation mechanisms and systematic approaches for identifying effective fine-tuning strategies. These limitations motivated the development of data-efficient and explainable supervised domain adaptation techniques.

A complementary set of deployment issues emerged while scaling the COVID-19 segmentation model across the Moscow healthcare network. When processing thousands of CT studies per day, the model encountered two major modes of failure: (i) systematic distributional changes caused by differing acquisition protocols -- notably reconstruction kernels and radiation dose; and (ii) clearly out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs -- such as head/abdomen scans routed into the chest stream, truncated volumes, or occasional synthetic/test images -- that the model was never trained to handle. These failure modes expose the limits of purely supervised adaptation: a large unlabeled stream of data and rare but clinically critical OOD cases demand methods that can adapt from unlabeled data and reliably detect and reject anomalies before producing clinical predictions.

Building upon these observations, we formulate two complementary research directions. The first follows unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) under CT reconstruction variability -- acute but understudied case where changes in reconstruction kernels induce significant distributional shifts. While UDA is a well-established topic in general machine learning research~\cite{dann}, existing approaches lack the specificity and theoretical grounding required for medical imaging data~\cite{gulrajani2020search,uda_survey_2020,zhuang2020comprehensive,peng2018visda,zhang2021empirical}. Therefore, we develop theoretically grounded models in our works~\cite{saparov2021zero,shimovolos2022adaptation}, then investigate the specificity of UDA on volumetric medical images in the subsequent work~\cite{shirokikh2025m3da}. The second direction addresses the problem of OOD detection in volumetric medical imaging. Although OOD detection methods have achieved strong results on natural images, they fail to scale effectively to 3D medical data, where both computational and statistical challenges are more severe~\cite{vasiliuk2023limitations}.

These gaps motivate the development of specialized domain adptation (DA) and OOD detection methods specifically tailored for real-world clinical environments and 3D medical image segmentation in particular. Although the general principles of DA are well established in machine learning, existing approaches show limited robustness to clinically relevant domain shifts -- such as differences in MRI intensity distributions and CT reconstruction kernels. Furthermore, the literature lacks standardized evaluation protocols that would enable systematic comparison of DA techniques in realistic medical scenarios.

This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by developing mathematically grounded and data-efficient DA methods, establishing comprehensive benchmarking frameworks, and publishing clinically relevant datasets that support reproducible evaluation. The proposed approaches address both supervised and unsupervised DA settings, as well as OOD detection in 3D medical imaging, thereby contributing to the reliability and interpretability of DL models in clinical practice.

In summary, the dissertation consolidates theoretical development, empirical validation, and dataset curation to advance the field of domain adaptation in medical imaging and to bring DL models closer to robust, real-world deployment.


\underline{\textbf{Goals and problems addressed.}}
The primary goal of this thesis is to address the challenges posed by domain shifts in 3D medical image segmentation, which are a significant obstacle to the reliable and accurate performance of DL models in real-world clinical settings. By investigating various sources of domain shifts, particularly in MRI and CT images, the thesis aims to develop robust methods that improve the generalization of segmentation models across different imaging domains. This work not only focuses on enhancing the performance of models through developing fine-tuning and DA methods but also introduces novel benchmarks and a dataset to ensure that these models can effectively handle OOD data, which is critical for the safe deployment of deep learning (DL) in medical applications.

	\item Establish benchmarks and datasets for DA and OOD detection in medical imaging to facilitate the evaluation and development of robust methods for 3D medical image segmentation.
	\item Examine existing DA and OOD detection methods and propose or indicate improvements.
\end{enumerate}
