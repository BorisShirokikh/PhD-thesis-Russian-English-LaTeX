I would like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my academic journey and during the preparation of this thesis.

First and foremost, I am deeply thankful to my primary supervisor, Mikhail Belyaev, for his unwavering support and guidance during my Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. studies. His insights into the research world and the knowledge he has shared have been invaluable in my academic and personal growth. Much of my scientific success is the result of our close collaboration and the work with his research team.

I am also deeply thankful to my collaborators and co-authors, who have greatly contributed to my scientific journey (in alphabetical order): Alexandra Dalechina, Daria Frolova, Mikhail Goncharov, Egor Krivov, Anvar Kurmukov, Ivan Oseledets, Maxim Panov, Mikhail Pautov, Maxim Pisov, Talgat Saparov, Alexey Shevtsov, Anton Vasiliuk, and Ivan Zakazov. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with and learn from such brilliant people.

I am deeply thankful to my family for their constant help and belief in me.
