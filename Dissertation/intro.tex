\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Introduction}


%Begin by providing a brief overview of power systems to set the context. Explain why power systems are critical, touching upon their role in modern society, economic importance, and their influence on technological advancements.
\section{Background and context.}
Carbon-free electricity generation is one of the most vital global challenges for the next decades. Renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydro, and solar power generation, are increasingly demanded, accessible, and widely used in modern power grids due to their ecological and economic benefits. For instance, Californiaâ€™s renewable portfolio standard currently mandates that 33\% of retail electricity sales come from renewable resources, with targets set to rise to 60\% by 2030 and 100\% by 2045. However, the integration of renewable energy generation introduces significant volatility and uncertainty to power systems, posing numerous challenges for operators. 

In 2020, electricity production accounted for approximately 25\% of greenhouse gas emissions in the USA, making the integration of renewable energy a critical strategy for reducing emissions. Nonetheless, the increased variability in power generation and disturbances associated with renewables compromise grid security and challenge traditional operation and planning policies. Integrating renewable energy sources also aligns with the United Nations' sustainable development goals by promoting affordable and clean energy while enhancing energy security and resilience. Unfortunately, these benefits come with substantial challenges to grid optimization and control policies due to the significant uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources.

%Example:
%"Power systems are the backbone of modern society, providing the necessary energy to drive economic activities, industrial processes, and daily life. As the demand for reliable and efficient energy continues to grow, the complexity and significance of power systems have increased, necessitating advanced research and development in this field."
\section{Problem statement.}
%2. Problem Statement
%Identify the specific problem or gap in the current knowledge that your research addresses. This should be a concise statement that clearly defines the issue your thesis will tackle.
Various algorithms have been developed to ensure grid reliability, utilizing methods ranging from machine learning to analytical and sampling-based approaches. Machine learning methods leverage historical data on weather, renewable generation, and grid operating parameters to estimate risks but are impractical for real-time operation due to their reliance on large datasets and extensive data collection times. Analytical approximation methods, which compute overload probabilities through integrals, often overestimate risks, particularly in rare events, compromising their practical efficiency. Sampling-based algorithms, such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, provide valuable alternatives for assessing reliability but struggle with the performance in evaluating rare, severe disturbances due to uniform exploration of fluctuation spaces.

The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, crucial for determining economically optimal power generation levels under given constraints, has several extensions to address uncertainty in power generation and consumption. Robust and chance-constrained formulations are popular, with the former assuming bounded uncertainty and the latter requiring high-probability satisfaction of security constraints. The Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (JCC-OPF) problem bounds the probability of security constraint failures but is computationally hard even under linear security limits and Gaussian uncertainty. Tractable convex approximations often yield conservative solutions unsuitable for practical operations. Scenario and Sample Average Approximations, which replace stochastic elements with deterministic inequalities, can handle non-Gaussian uncertainties but may require a large number of samples, complicating their application in large-scale grids.

Additionally, the discrete-time dynamic chance-constrained OPF problem addresses optimal generation set-points over sequential timestamps, incorporating ramp-up and ramp-down constraints to manage the rate of power output changes. Automatic Generation Control (AGC) aids in efficient power dispatch, yet solving the chance-constrained problem for arbitrary distributions and joint technical limits remains computationally infeasible. Data-driven approximations, such as Scenario Approximation (SA) and Sample Average Approximation (SAA), although effective, are often computationally prohibitive when high accuracy is needed, necessitating extensive scenario reduction studies. This complexity highlights the need for improved methods to handle the uncertainties and operational challenges posed by the integration of renewable energy sources into power systems.

Summing up, modern power system are influenced by various uncertainty sources and require modern data-driven and data-efficient methods to, firstly, estimate reliability of the current power system state, secondly, reliably control the conventional generators to reach the most economically efficient state, simultaneously satistying demand and meeting technical constraints.

%Example:
%"Despite significant advancements in power systems, challenges remain in improving the efficiency and stability of power grids, particularly with the integration of renewable energy sources. This research aims to address these challenges by exploring new circuit designs and control strategies."
\section{Research objectives.}

This research aims to develop advanced methods for improving the efficiency and accuracy of reliability assessments and optimization in power systems under uncertainty. We propose an adaptive importance sampling method to estimate the risk of reliability constraints violation more efficiently. This method utilizes physical information to create a mixture of distributions for sampling and employs convex optimization to iteratively adjust the weights of the mixture. By incorporating importance sampling, we aim to reduce the complexity and enhance the accuracy of scenario approximations for chance-constrained optimal power flow. This approach generates more informative samples, resulting in an optimization problem with fewer constraints. Additionally, we propose an A-priori Reduced Scenario Approximation (AR-SA) method, which integrates data-driven scenario approximation techniques to reduce the number of samples required while maintaining solution reliability. This method seeks to provide theoretical guarantees for the feasibility of solutions in joint chance-constrained dynamic optimal power flow problems. Our research extends existing importance sampling techniques and contributes to more effective and practical solutions for managing uncertainties in power system operations.
